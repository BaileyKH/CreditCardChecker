# CreditCardChecker

## What does it do?
In this small project we:
- First create an array for possible credit card numbers (valid or invalid)
- Create our functions to first validate our credit cards, then find invalid cards
- Then find invalid cars
- Finally validating the card to the company in which it belongs
